Given the continued \nrelevance of the areas covered by the previous key strategic orientations and the new \ndevelopments, the following key strategic orientations for R&I are defined for 2025-2027: \n\t•\nTHE GREEN TRANSITION;\n\t•\nTHE DIGITAL TRANSITION; AND\n\t•\nA MORE RESILIENT, COMPETITIVE, INCLUSIVE, AND DEMOCRATIC EUROPE.\nThese three key strategic orientations are strongly interrelated and will strengthen each other. \nNow more than ever, the EU must gear R&I investment towards the challenge of addressing \nclimate change and reversing the planet’s natural resources decline, while ensuring food and \nnutrition security. Digital technologies have a key role to play in making our economy and \nindustry (more) resource efficient, less polluting, circular and climate neutral. Similarly, the \ngreen transition of energy, mobility and industry sectors can help counteract the growing \ndemand for energy and natural resources and reduce the environmental footprint of the \ndigital sector. Both the green and the digital transitions, together with the new geopolitical \nsituation and global health threats, call for a resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic \nEurope.\nTo achieve the EU’s ambitions reflected in the new key strategic orientations, it is also \nessential and urgent to safeguard Europe’s open strategic autonomy and to secure Europe’s \nleading role in developing and deploying critical and emerging technologies."

This means additional development steps, uncertainties, and a \nlonger time to market. Therefore, it remains important to ensure continued support to studies \nfor health assessment procedures, clinical performance demonstration, quality assurance \nschemes and standardisation. Research and innovation are also still needed to develop \nnew cross-sectoral business models that enable health-related industries to cooperate \nearly with healthcare systems in the development of value-added products and services for \neffective uptake and deployment of innovative solutions. Such solutions should deliver on \nthe triple aim of improving the patient experience of care (including safety, quality, equity \nand satisfaction), improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita cost of \nhealthcare. Furthermore, when there is an unmet need and a market failure, incentives and \nsupport will be considered to promote the demand of innovative goods and services and to \nfoster the uptake of innovation in health systems. \nTable 1 .

Raising awareness to social and collective \nresponsibility and the trust in and the uptake of sustainable solutions as well as facilitating \nco-creation processes are part of this. \nKey strategic orientation 2: Digital transition\nInvestment in R&I in key digital technologies is crucial for improving Europe’s competitiveness \nin the digital value chain, integrating world-leading digital capabilities and technologies into \nits economy and industry, and strengthening its position in global markets of innovative \ngoods and services. Such investment is also crucial to ensure that digital technologies uphold, \nby design, Europe’s principles and values, and peoples’ rights. \nArtificial intelligence is transforming our society and the way we do science. It acts as a \ncatalyst for scientific breakthroughs in a variety of scientific fields and a key instrument in \nthe scientific progress needed for tackling the green and digital transitions. Geopolitically, \nleadership in AI-powered science is essential for Europe’s competitive edge, prosperity, \nand technological sovereignty. The European AI-strategy is guided by the dual principle of \nexcellence in AI and trustworthy AI, which, along with a thorough but innovation-friendly \nregulatory framework, such as the Artificial Intelligence Act19, can harness AI’s vast potential \nwhile protecting the rights and private spheres of the European people. Achieving this depends \non the collective commitment of all stakeholders in the European scientific and innovation \ncommunity to develop research and innovation ecosystems that are AI-ready. Encouraging \npeople – especially underrepresented groups – to get involved is essential for advancing the \ndevelopment of trustworthy and bias-free Artificial Intelligence. \nThe EU’s ability to defend and promote its economic and societal interests, as well as its \ncredibility as a strong policy actor on the global stage, will largely be a function of its cyber \nresilience and digital technologies command."

    "Their aim is to channel efforts and actions \nacross programmes and actors to support a limited number of well-defined, urgent and \nbold global challenges that have the potential to garner the engagement and support of \npolicymakers, stakeholders and the wider public. Following a preparatory phase, in 2021 five \nEU Missions were launched: Adaptation to Climate Change; Cancer; Restore our Ocean and \nWaters; Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities; and a Soil Deal for Europe.\nA 2023 assessment35 confirmed that during their first 2 years, EU Missions have supported \nthe EU’s work on the European Green Deal, making Europe fit for the digital age, and Europe’s \nBeating Cancer Plan. Since their inception, EU Missions have demonstrated their potential \nto accelerate change: They break silos, support the implementation of policies and the \nshaping of policy actions, and allow for flexibility and experimentation. At the same time, EU \nMissions promote a large-scale mobilisation of stakeholders, leading to a quicker and wider \ndeployment of new approaches and technologies by fostering greater collective ownership. \nSupported primarily by Horizon Europe funding, they have also connected and supported EU \npolicies and programmes with local action and stakeholder engagement and are on track to \nachieve their ambitious goals by 2030.\nIn 2025-2027, more work will be done to ensure that missions successfully shift from \ntheir initial phase to deployment and impact. First, a strengthened and better coordinated \nadministrative governance will enable missions to be effective. Horizon Europe investment \nwill help strengthen joint support functions (‘back office’ tasks) for all current and future EU \nMissions to facilitate access to resources and actions to achieve mission objectives. Second, \na broader portfolio of instruments will be mobilised, including public-private partnerships \nand the public procurement of innovation. While Horizon Europe funding will guarantee \ncontinuity and help to maintain the pace of mission implementation, diversifying funding and \nfinancing sources is crucial to support a pipeline of activities from research to deployment. \nThe interdisciplinary nature of the governance mechanisms offers ample opportunities \nfor building synergies between the EU Missions and other parts of Horizon Europe, the EU \nMissions and other EU instruments and the EU Missions and national, regional and local \npolicies and funding programmes.\nAchieving the goals of individual EU Missions will ultimately hinge on broad public support \nand acceptance of the necessary green and digital transitions. Horizon Europe will support \nadditional efforts to raise awareness on mission impacts, to strengthen stakeholder feedback \nmechanisms and to increase the visibility of the missions and their concrete actions on the \nground. To this end, communication with relevant stakeholder groups and the general public \nwill be stepped up significantly.\n35. \u0007See the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and \nthe Committee of the Regions ‘EU Missions two years on: assessment of progress and way forward’ (COM(2023) 457) and the staff working \ndocument accompanying the Commission's Communication on the assessment of the Missions, SWD(2023) 260.",

Contributions of pillars and clusters to each of the key strategic \norientations are described in the following chapter.\nKey strategic orientation 1: Green transition\nThe European Green Deal17 outlines an ambitious plan to address climate, energy and \nenvironmental challenges while boosting Europe’s competitiveness. It aims to create a more \njust, inclusive and sustainable future by ensuring the security of food and of other critical \nresources. This includes protecting and restoring nature, reversing ecosystem degradation \nand biodiversity loss, and keeping human activities within the safe limits of planetary \nboundaries and the carrying capacity of the planet. A key goal for Europe is to become the \nworld’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. To achieve this, the EU must shift towards a \ngrowth model that benefits the planet more than it harms it.\nHorizon Europe will deliver on the European Green Deal. Investment under Horizon Europe \nwill be aligned with strategic priorities helping to bring about the green transition, promoting \nsocietal changes, and prioritising circular and less polluting practices as well as systemic \nand behavioural changes. This will help reduce the pressure on natural resources, enabling \nsustainable development, generating sustainable quality jobs and ensuring economic \ninclusivity to leave no one behind. The green transition’s success relies on creating a strong, \ncompetitive, clean and sustainable economy based on renewable energy and circularity \nprinciples, along with a skilled workforce.\nHorizon Europe does not only sustain the EU’s leadership in climate and biodiversity diplomacy \nand green innovation, but it also increases the EU’s open strategic autonomy in the area. \nThis path involves modernising and decarbonising Europe’s industry and society, driven by \nleadership in net zero technologies and circular economy.\nGiven the urgency of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and \npollution as well as other environmental challenges, addressing this crisis requires an \nunprecedented mobilisation of R&I across all sectors. This encompasses collaborative \nfundamental research and innovative solutions, particularly in areas like health, urban \nplanning, construction, energy efficiency, mobility, agriculture and food systems."

This requires on the one hand enhancing technological detection, and \non the other hand increasing overall perceptions of security via e.g. security-by-design \napproaches. It also requires innovative approaches to measure perceptions of security. \nThe perception of security contributes to regaining the confidence of European citizens in \nplaces that have been targets of terrorism.\n\t•\nContributing to achieving and improving European open strategic autonomy in \ntechnologies identified as critical for civil security. This will be done by developing European \nsolutions for the capability needs of European security practitioners, by contributing to an \nEU industrial policy and by increasing research security.\nCluster 3 will require, where appropriate, that projects:\n\t•\ndo piloting in operational environments and that they be validated by the practitioners \nof the developed capability, including over extended periods of time when appropriate;\n 77\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\n\t•\ndedicate specific work packages to market uptake and industrialisation issues, including \npotential synergies with other EU and national funds;\n\t•\nassess their solutions in terms of environmental sustainability, e.g. AI algorithms that \nconsume less energy;\n\t•\ndevelop relevant education and training curricula, especially for security practitioners \nbut also for other relevant authorities and for critical infrastructure operators, and that \nthey raise the general public’s awareness of security including with educational tools \nwhere relevant;\n\t•\nidentify lessons learnt at the end of the project for possible future ones.\nThe EU also needs to be able to rapidly (re-)deploy research to deal with new threats and \nto accelerate innovation.

It \nwill address environmental crime. It will help understand how to manage borders in case of \npotential large-scale movements of people, including those caused by environmental stress. \nIt will promote environmental sustainability of security solutions. Cluster 3 aims to guarantee \n 20\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nthe security of digital networks and of the population in the online world. The goal is \nto create a secure and trustworthy digital environment by ensuring an open, stable and \nsecure cyberspace as well as secure hardware and software systems. Therefore, Cluster 3 \nwill invest in cybersecurity R&I to strengthen the EU’s resilience, protect its infrastructures, \nand improve its ability to cope with cyber incidents. This will help increase the EU’s open \nstrategic autonomy in cybersecurity. Cluster 3 addresses cybercrime and the developing \nsecurity threats in a digital age, such as criminal use of AI, to protect Europeans against \ncyber-enabled crimes. It will also continue to harness the opportunities of new technologies \nfor law enforcement and border management.\nCluster 3 aims to strengthen societal preparedness and resilience to disasters and threats of \nall kinds, whether accidental or intentional, of human origin or caused by nature. It will do this \nby improving disaster risk management and by involving and providing tools to the general \npublic, local, regional and national decision-makers, and operational responders.\nCluster 3 will improve the preparedness and response to the changing threat landscape of \nterrorism, corruption, organised crime, and attacks on critical infrastructure, including hybrid \nthreats. This will be done by understanding the threats, including the underpinning societal \nissues, and by developing tools to prevent, detect and investigate them. R&I activities will \nalso continue to enable resilience of critical infrastructure (e.g. energy, water and food supply, \nhealth) in case of physical or cyberattacks.\nCluster 3 will also aim for a seamless border passage for legitimate travellers and goods \nwhile ensuring internal security and thus integrity of the Schengen area. This will be done \nby developing capabilities in the areas of border management, customs and supply chain \nsecurity, as well as capabilities required for civilian maritime security.\nCluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space\nCluster 4 aims to both: (i) strengthen Europe’s technological sovereignty and \ncompetitiveness; and (ii) support the transformation of its industries towards net-\nzero emissions."

Achieving open strategic autonomy in global space-based infrastructures, services, \napplications and data\nPeople in Europe should be allowed to reap the benefits of space services, data and \napplications. Today, many sectors of the EU economy rely on services, data and applications \nfrom space. This includes satellite navigation for mobility and transport, agriculture and \nland management, banking and other financial transactions and energy management. In \naddition, satellite Earth observation is very important for i) environmental monitoring and \nfollow-up, ii) mitigating pollution and climate change, whether on land, in the air or at sea \nand iii) emergency management situations. It plays a key role in the implementation of the \nEuropean Green Deal objectives. Finally, some other technologies that also play a crucial role \nin security and resilience when dealing with threats, natural or human, include: (i) space-based \nsituational awareness; (ii) telecommunications; (iii) satellite navigation and positioning; and \n(iv) in-space services. The EU space industry is an important part of the EU economy, being \na global market leader in some sectors while being more of a challenger in others. Cluster \n4’s space component will help further strengthen the EU’s capacity to: (i) conceive, develop, \noperate and exploit competitive space technologies, systems and data and the associated \nservices and applications in space and on the ground; and (ii) develop new flexible, scalable, \nsecure and sustainable system approaches, ensuring freedom of action and autonomy. The \nnon-dependence and resilience of EU space technologies and strategic assets also need to be \nensured. Space is a sector that helps to ensure that the EU is not dependent on other parts \nof the globe when security and/or political independence aspects come into play. It also helps \nto: (i) protect EU infrastructure and strategic assets from damage, be it from natural hazards \nor human threats; and (ii) increase the ability of EU infrastructures to scale up and adapt. \n20.",

European Commission, Directorate-General for Communication, European green deal – Delivering on our targets, Publications Office of the \nEuropean Union, 2021, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2775/373022\n18. For more information, see the dedicated web page on the New European Bauhaus.\n 14\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nThe EU will need to make improvements in several areas to address ongoing and future \nthreats. In particular, it will be necessary to improve the EU’s response in two areas: (i) its \nresilience to climate-related extreme events like heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires; \nand (ii) its readiness to confront the emergence of new, climate-related, cross-border health \nand biological threats. Improvements in these two areas will also have the co-benefits \nof protecting cultural heritage and landscapes from natural and human-made risks and \nbetter addressing water resilience. These improvements will also require: (i) behavioural \nand structural change at societal level; (ii) transformational decision-making; and (iii) social \nacceptance. To prepare for these changes, it will be important to conduct research in social \nsciences, humanities, law, and governance. Raising awareness to social and collective \nresponsibility and the trust in and the uptake of sustainable solutions as well as facilitating \nco-creation processes are part of this. \nKey strategic orientation 2: Digital transition\nInvestment in R&I in key digital technologies is crucial for improving Europe’s competitiveness \nin the digital value chain, integrating world-leading digital capabilities and technologies into \nits economy and industry, and strengthening its position in global markets of innovative \ngoods and services. Such investment is also crucial to ensure that digital technologies uphold, \nby design, Europe’s principles and values, and peoples’ rights. \nArtificial intelligence is transforming our society and the way we do science. It acts as a \ncatalyst for scientific breakthroughs in a variety of scientific fields and a key instrument in \nthe scientific progress needed for tackling the green and digital transitions. Geopolitically, \nleadership in AI-powered science is essential for Europe’s competitive edge, prosperity, \nand technological sovereignty. The European AI-strategy is guided by the dual principle of \nexcellence in AI and trustworthy AI, which, along with a thorough but innovation-friendly \nregulatory framework, such as the Artificial Intelligence Act19, can harness AI’s vast potential \nwhile protecting the rights and private spheres of the European people. Achieving this depends \non the collective commitment of all stakeholders in the European scientific and innovation \ncommunity to develop research and innovation ecosystems that are AI-ready. Encouraging \npeople – especially underrepresented groups – to get involved is essential for advancing the \ndevelopment of trustworthy and bias-free Artificial Intelligence. \nThe EU’s ability to defend and promote its economic and societal interests, as well as its \ncredibility as a strong policy actor on the global stage, will largely be a function of its cyber \nresilience and digital technologies command.",

However, the pace of implementation of the changes \nneeded is still slow, and these changes are often implemented in a compartmentalised way. \nEurope needs to further accelerate the transformation of its industrial value chains in the \nbuilt environment to increase circularity and climate neutrality.\nThe NEB is a pioneering movement paying special attention to the built environment, bringing \ntogether all types of stakeholders (the general public, universities, research institutes, \nmunicipalities, national and regional authorities, architects, artists, communities, and \nbusinesses) to promote transformative innovation in support of the Green Deal. \n 25\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nMore specifically, the NEB as a cross-cluster issue will focus on the following three R&I \ncomponents:\n\t•\nCircular and regenerative approaches for the construction ecosystem: This R&I \ncomponent would look in-depth at transforming the construction ecosystem from a linear \nto a model based on circularity and regeneration, by focusing on innovative materials and \nproducts (e.g. re-use, preparing for re-use, recycling, by-products, alternative sourcing \nof construction material, focusing on secondary sources, etc.), as well as circular and \nregenerative design and construction techniques (e.g., built environment as a carbon sink, \ndesign for deconstruction, modularity, AI-powered design) also including arts, design and \narchitecture considerations. It will also take into consideration that such transformations \nalso need to be applicable to social and affordable housing. \n\t•\nConnecting the green transformation, social inclusion and local democracy: This \nR&I component will unlock the potential of the social sciences and humanities, the arts, \nculture and design to further explore and experiment with the transformative potential of \nparticipatory practices and governance models that balance public and private interests."

This involves developing \nsystemic approaches, embedding the digital and the green transitions, and maintaining a \nhighly competitive health industry and a well-trained healthcare workforce in Europe.\nCluster 2 – Culture, Creativity, and Inclusive Society\nThe cluster aims to make Europe more resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic. It \nwill work with interdisciplinary approaches on measures from preservation to a call to action \nand engagement. R&I investment will continue to strengthen democracy, increase democratic \nparticipation, and protect fundamental rights and the rule of law. Cluster 2 will help produce \nevidence-based strategies to manage demographic change, mobility, and migration, and \n 19\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nfoster the inclusion of refugees and migrants in European society. Activities will help increase \nsocial resilience, tackle polarisation and political extremism by contributing to the fight against \nhatred, antisemitism and conspiracy theories, and build trust in democratic governance. \nCluster 2 will also promote cultural and creative industries and linguistic diversity, paying \nparticular attention to regional specificities and cultural diversity, as this enriches society as \na whole. This area will explore the relation between artistic expression, social inclusion, and \nwell-being, particularly among vulnerable individuals, such as older people and populations at \nrisk of isolation. In this context, the link between art, culture and health will be emphasised, \ncontributing to a more resilient and inclusive Europe.\nCluster 2 also aims to increase awareness and understanding of the political, cultural and \nsocioeconomic challenges caused by environmental crises and the measures needed to \ncounteract them. It wants to ensure that the transition to a more climate-friendly society \nand economic model is done democratically and in a fair and inclusive manner. This work will \nalso lead to new ways of governing, and create sustainable growth, which is a prerequisite \nfor building resilient, fair and sustainable societies.\nCluster 2 will continue to promote people’s involvement and to build trust in democratic \nprocesses to address climate change. It will support innovative and interdisciplinary research \nthat builds on the social sciences and humanities. Additionally, investment will help to: (i) \nprotect cultural and linguistic heritage and landscapes from natural and human-made risks; \nand (ii) foster sustainable and innovative practices in cultural and creative industries.\nFurthermore, Cluster 2 will continue to support the human-centred approach to the digital \ntransition.

For more information, see the dedicated web page on the New European Bauhaus.\n 14\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nThe EU will need to make improvements in several areas to address ongoing and future \nthreats. In particular, it will be necessary to improve the EU’s response in two areas: (i) its \nresilience to climate-related extreme events like heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires; \nand (ii) its readiness to confront the emergence of new, climate-related, cross-border health \nand biological threats. Improvements in these two areas will also have the co-benefits \nof protecting cultural heritage and landscapes from natural and human-made risks and \nbetter addressing water resilience. These improvements will also require: (i) behavioural \nand structural change at societal level; (ii) transformational decision-making; and (iii) social \nacceptance.

Moreover, addressing health, climate change, biodiversity loss, \npollution and other environmental challenges, and protection of cultural heritage requires \nidentifying and implementing solutions at global level, where international cooperation is \nessential.\nThe EU's approach to international cooperation will continue to focus on openness of Horizon \nEurope and multilateralism, combined with strategic targeted actions with key partners from \noutside the EU. In this way, the EU will ensure the success of the Global Gateway., the \nEuropean Union’s strategy to better connect the world.\nActions set out in the Horizon Europe strategic plan for 2025-2027 will remain open to \nparticipation of legal entities from non-EU countries.

It \nwill address environmental crime. It will help understand how to manage borders in case of \npotential large-scale movements of people, including those caused by environmental stress. \nIt will promote environmental sustainability of security solutions. Cluster 3 aims to guarantee \n 20\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nthe security of digital networks and of the population in the online world. The goal is \nto create a secure and trustworthy digital environment by ensuring an open, stable and \nsecure cyberspace as well as secure hardware and software systems. Therefore, Cluster 3 \nwill invest in cybersecurity R&I to strengthen the EU’s resilience, protect its infrastructures, \nand improve its ability to cope with cyber incidents. This will help increase the EU’s open \nstrategic autonomy in cybersecurity. Cluster 3 addresses cybercrime and the developing \nsecurity threats in a digital age, such as criminal use of AI, to protect Europeans against \ncyber-enabled crimes. It will also continue to harness the opportunities of new technologies \nfor law enforcement and border management.\nCluster 3 aims to strengthen societal preparedness and resilience to disasters and threats of \nall kinds, whether accidental or intentional, of human origin or caused by nature. It will do this \nby improving disaster risk management and by involving and providing tools to the general \npublic, local, regional and national decision-makers, and operational responders.\nCluster 3 will improve the preparedness and response to the changing threat landscape of \nterrorism, corruption, organised crime, and attacks on critical infrastructure, including hybrid \nthreats. This will be done by understanding the threats, including the underpinning societal \nissues, and by developing tools to prevent, detect and investigate them.

They \nare important for open strategic autonomy and sovereignty in industrial value chains and \ncan be described in terms of technology readiness levels (TRLs). However, some knowledge-\ngenerating activities with a societal and scientific impact go beyond the technology based \nTRL logic. Nevertheless, they lay the foundation for the next generation of technologies and \nare also crucial for societal transformation processes. R&I activities for societal transitions \nrequire recognising wider groups of innovation stakeholders such as civil society, public \nservices and local administrations, and their innovation needs and opportunities.\nThe 2025-2027 Horizon Europe work programmes will be designed to provide a balanced \nsupport to activities with a range of maturity and of technology readiness levels, ranging \nfrom knowledge-generating and early-stage research to innovation, demonstration and first \ndeployment activities, such as in model regions, living labs and lighthouses.

It acts as a \ncatalyst for scientific breakthroughs in a variety of scientific fields and a key instrument in \nthe scientific progress needed for tackling the green and digital transitions. Geopolitically, \nleadership in AI-powered science is essential for Europe’s competitive edge, prosperity, \nand technological sovereignty. The European AI-strategy is guided by the dual principle of \nexcellence in AI and trustworthy AI, which, along with a thorough but innovation-friendly \nregulatory framework, such as the Artificial Intelligence Act19, can harness AI’s vast potential \nwhile protecting the rights and private spheres of the European people. Achieving this depends \non the collective commitment of all stakeholders in the European scientific and innovation \ncommunity to develop research and innovation ecosystems that are AI-ready.

Achieving sustainable, inclusive, and competitive transport modes\nTransport is the only sector where greenhouse gas emissions have increased in the past three \ndecades, rising by 33.5% between 1990 and 2019. The transport sector is responsible for \n23% of CO2 emissions in the EU (of which over 70% comes from road transport) and remains \ndependent on oil for 92% of its energy demand. This sector is also one of the main causes \nof air pollution and noise and is a major source of water pollution. Greater R&I activities \nare needed, across all transport modes and in line with societal needs and preferences, for \nthe EU to reach its policy goals towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, to significantly \nreduce air pollutants and noise towards the zero-pollution ambition, and to support and \naccelerate positive developments. Electrification of all modes of transport plays a key role in \nthis process, and a rapid deployment of the European battery value chain is a major priority \nto achieve this aim.\nAs regards road transport, R&I actions, in particular from the related Cluster 5 partnerships, \nwill contribute to the shift to zero-emission mobility (greenhouse gases, noise and air \npollutants), ensuring that the EU remains the world leader in innovation, manufacturing \nand services in relation to road transport. R&I will target cost- and energy-efficient zero \ntailpipe emission vehicles (from two-wheeler to heavy-duty), smart, user-centric and cost-\neffective static and dynamic charging infrastructure, and the integration of these vehicles \ninto a resilient mobility system and in the renewable, smart energy grid.\nAviation is a strategic sector for the EU and aims at climate neutrality by 2050 with very \nambitious technology bricks, which include hybridisation, energy efficiency improvements, and \n100% use of sustainable aviation fuels and (partially) electrified or hydrogen-powered, zero-\nemission commercial aircraft and infrastructure by 2035. R&I actions on aviation will develop \nenabling and integrated aircraft technologies for deep decarbonisation transformation, \nreducing all negative aviation impacts and greenhouse gas emissions (including noise and \nair pollutants), while strengthening Europe’s aero-industry collaboration and industrial \nleadership position.\nFor waterborne transport, R&I actions will further advance development and demonstration \nof solutions in the shipping sector by 2030 that are of net-zero emissions and zero pollution \n(including from cargo), aiming at climate neutrality by 2050. This will be by improving \n 113\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nits system efficiency, safety and security, and enhancing digitalisation, automation and \nconnectivity, including EU satellite navigation solutions.

This can \nbuild on ongoing synergy activities, for instance facilitating future applications of relevant \nCluster 5 projects to the Innovation Fund, organisation of workshops for informing mature \nR&I projects about funding opportunities under the Innovation Fund, and the funding of \ndedicated synergy work programme topics. It is expected that the activities to foster \nsynergies with the Innovation Fund already carried out in 2021-2024 will continue into \nthe second half of the programme (covering 2025-2027) and be fine-tuned as necessary \nto further increase their effectiveness.\n\t•\nThe Connecting Europe Facility may also offer opportunities for funding the deployment \nof innovative solutions developed in the EU R&I framework programmes (and in particular, \nthe necessary infrastructure for enabling their roll-out), in the areas of transport and \nenergy.

Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society\nThe expected impact is that people of all ages in the EU stay healthy, resilient, and independent \neven as society changes fast. This will arise from healthier lifestyles and behaviour, healthier \ndiets, healthier environments, improved evidence-informed health policies, and more \neffective solutions for health and well-being promotion, disease prevention and monitoring, \nand rehabilitation.\nResearch and innovation (R&I) is needed to improve the understanding of health and care \nneeds throughout the life course, including those related to health disparities (e.g. needs \nspecific to age, sex, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation and vulnerable populations). \nWith this knowledge, more personalised, effective, accessible, and affordable solutions can be \ndeveloped for promoting health and well-being, pursuing health equity, preventing diseases, \nand for planning, implementing and monitoring care and (re)habilitation. This includes \naddressing the needs related to chronic health conditions, physical disabilities, mental health \nissues and disabilities, or age-related impairments.",
    "Healthcare systems \nIn the table, partnerships are indicated for one impact even if some of them contribute to several impacts.\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\nInternational cooperation is a natural component of health research and innovation. Over \nrecent decades, the EU has established solid links with non-EU countries and international \norganisations primarily via global multilateral initiatives.\nRecent examples demonstrate the ever-growing need for a global response to increasing \nhealth challenges: cross-border health threats such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic; the \nspread of antimicrobial resistance; environmental factors in an urban or rural context creating \nsimilar exposure and occurrences in different regions of the world; the health impacts of \nclimate change, biodiversity loss and pollution; and the impacts of Russia’s war of aggression \nagainst Ukraine and of the displacement of war-affected people on all aspects of health.\nWith the EU Global Health Strategy, the EU seeks to regain lost ground to reach the universal \nhealth-related targets under the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. \nHorizon Europe’s Health Cluster will remain an essential vehicle for executing the EU’s \ninternational commitments on global health, notably Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG \n3) on health and well-being for all, the objectives and targets of World Health Organization \n(WHO) action plans and programmes, and the dialogue on health themes within international \nfora such as G7, G20 and with other global partners. In the context of global health, the \nHealth Cluster’s ability to react swiftly and decisively to public health emergencies remains \nof utmost importance.\nSeeking synergies with the EU’s external cooperation and humanitarian policies and \nprogrammes will not only deepen the links between health research and its implementation. \nIt will also amplify the uptake and deployment of R&I results and solutions across the globe \nand thus the impact of EU investment. International actions of the Health Cluster will be \nin line with the EU’s Global Approach to Research and Innovation and the EU Global Health \nStrategy (2022).\nIn the framework of global health, the main areas of cooperation with the World Health \nOrganization, other international organisations and bodies, and low and middle-income \ncountries are set out below.\n 58\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\n\t•\nInfectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance, and poverty-related and neglected \ninfectious diseases through the Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking, which is the third \nprogramme of the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP). \nIt aims to accelerate the clinical development of new or improved health technology \nproducts in sub-Saharan Africa.

The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda \nfor the past 3 years, leveraging the power of inclusiveness, sustainability, arts and culture \nfor the green transition.\nThe EU has now put in place a substantial regulatory framework for the green transition and \nhas also mobilised substantial funding. However, the pace of implementation of the changes \nneeded is still slow, and these changes are often implemented in a compartmentalised way. \nEurope needs to further accelerate the transformation of its industrial value chains in the \nbuilt environment to increase circularity and climate neutrality.\nThe NEB is a pioneering movement paying special attention to the built environment, bringing \ntogether all types of stakeholders (the general public, universities, research institutes, \nmunicipalities, national and regional authorities, architects, artists, communities, and \nbusinesses) to promote transformative innovation in support of the Green Deal. \n 25\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\nMore specifically, the NEB as a cross-cluster issue will focus on the following three R&I \ncomponents:\n\t•\nCircular and regenerative approaches for the construction ecosystem: This R&I \ncomponent would look in-depth at transforming the construction ecosystem from a linear \nto a model based on circularity and regeneration, by focusing on innovative materials and \nproducts (e.g. re-use, preparing for re-use, recycling, by-products, alternative sourcing \nof construction material, focusing on secondary sources, etc.), as well as circular and \nregenerative design and construction techniques (e.g., built environment as a carbon sink, \ndesign for deconstruction, modularity, AI-powered design) also including arts, design and \narchitecture considerations. It will also take into consideration that such transformations \nalso need to be applicable to social and affordable housing. \n\t•\nConnecting the green transformation, social inclusion and local democracy: This \nR&I component will unlock the potential of the social sciences and humanities, the arts, \nculture and design to further explore and experiment with the transformative potential of \nparticipatory practices and governance models that balance public and private interests.",

As such, the \ntransfer of these results to specific settings is a challenge that lies beyond the cluster. Here \nsynergies with specific sectors and place-based innovation ecosystems are needed. More \nproactive approaches to foster certain synergies will be developed under this strategic plan.\n\t•\nSynergies with the Innovation Fund: In 2023, a coordination and support action co-\nfunded by Cluster 4 was included in Cluster 5 to encourage the take-up of Horizon 2020 \nresults by the Innovation Fund, including Cluster 4 priorities in energy-intensive industries, \ncarbon capture utilisation and storage and the new space ecosystem (i.e. the Cassini \ninitiative). Topics in these areas under the 2023-2024 work programme encourage GHG \navoidance methodology under the Innovation Fund to be used and exploitation plans to \nbe developed in line with the Innovation Fund’s criteria. It is expected that the efforts \nto foster synergies with the Innovation Fund will continue into the second half of the \nprogramme.\n\t•\nSynergies with the Digital Europe Programme: The Digital Europe Programme aims \nat deploying digital data, communication and computing capacities across Europe \nand increasing their take-up in industry, businesses, research institutions and public \nservices. It also aims at developing people’s digital skills and increasing the number of \nICT professionals. To achieve these aims, there is potential to implement downstream \nsequential synergies with Cluster 4. Data spaces deployed under the Digital Europe \nProgramme will use compliance and interoperability technologies developed under \nCluster 4, but data spaces can also be made available to Horizon Europe stakeholders, \nwhich can lead to upstream sequential synergy. This is also relevant for experimentation \nand testing facilities, as once validated in the labs, the technology can be tested in \na real-life environment.",
    "Moreover, the EU will strengthen \ninternational cooperation in several other areas of transport research, for instance in aviation, \nmaritime shipping, inland waterway transport, road safety and connected and automated \nmobility, where the different regions can benefit from exchanges of research experience, \ndevelop common standards, and harmonise developments at a global level.\nThe EU plans to develop further the AU-EU Research and Innovation Partnership on Climate \nChange and Sustainable Energy, emanating from the AU-EU High-level Policy Dialogue \n 116\nHORIZON EUROPE strategic plan | 2025 – 2027\n(‘Africa initiative’), to implement the AU-EU Innovation Agenda94 adopted in July 2023, to \ncontinue cooperation on research and innovation with its neighbour countries, in particular \nwithin the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (‘Mediterranean initiative’), and with \nstrategic and like-minded partners in the Americas (including the new EU-Latin America and \nthe Caribbean initiative currently under preparation) and Asia, in the framework of its energy, \ntransport and research and innovation dialogues, and connectivity partnerships.\nSynergies with other EU funding programmes\nMany efforts have been made into identifying and exploiting synergies with other EU funding \nprogrammes, of which the following may have the most direct links with Cluster 5.\n\t•\nThe Innovation Fund can provide sequential downstream funding for innovative low-\ncarbon technologies in energy and transport (of which many are in the scope of Cluster \n5), thereby accelerating the commercialisation and deployment of R&I results. This can \nbuild on ongoing synergy activities, for instance facilitating future applications of relevant \nCluster 5 projects to the Innovation Fund, organisation of workshops for informing mature \nR&I projects about funding opportunities under the Innovation Fund, and the funding of \ndedicated synergy work programme topics. It is expected that the activities to foster \nsynergies with the Innovation Fund already carried out in 2021-2024 will continue into \nthe second half of the programme (covering 2025-2027) and be fine-tuned as necessary \nto further increase their effectiveness.\n\t•\nThe Connecting Europe Facility may also offer opportunities for funding the deployment \nof innovative solutions developed in the EU R&I framework programmes (and in particular, \nthe necessary infrastructure for enabling their roll-out), in the areas of transport and \nenergy. Building on existing successful cross-fertilisation between the Horizon Europe \nframework programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (e.g. as regards hydrogen \napplications in the mobility sector, alternative fuels infrastructure, adaptation of transport \ninfrastructure to climate change, intelligent road transport, logistics, urban mobility/\nnodes and smart grids), Cluster 5 intends to further increase synergies, for instance by \norganising targeted events for raising awareness of programme activities or by aligning \nHorizon Europe work programmes and the Connecting Europe Facility, so that deployment \nof innovative mobility solutions can be supported.\n\t•\nThe LIFE programme facilitates sequential downstream funding of innovations by \ngranting bonus points in the evaluation when proposals directly use results of Horizon-\nfunded projects. LIFE’s subprogrammes (notably on clean energy transition and on \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation) contribute to the same objectives as Cluster \n5 activities – i.e."
