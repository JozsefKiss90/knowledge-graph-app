🧠 Node: EU health industry
📄 Summary (8 sentences): The expected impact is that the EU health industry is innovative, sustainable, and globally competitive. This is thanks to improved uptake of breakthrough technologies and innovations. R&I is needed to help implement the digital single market strategy and the pharmaceutical strategy for Europe. The health sector is subject to strict regulatory requirements that impose the demonstration of safety and clinical benefits. This means additional development steps, uncertainties, and a longer time to market. Research and innovation are also still needed to develop cross-sectoral business models that enable health-related industries to cooperate with healthcare systems in the development of value-added products and services. The Mission will also contribute to the Mission on Cancer Plan68, a major pillar of the European Health Union’s COVID68.
