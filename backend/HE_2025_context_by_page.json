It provides \nplanning stability\n \nfor the research community beyond the custom 2-year period of Horizon Europe work \nprogrammes. At the same time, it provides a certain degree of \n˜exibility \nto respond to \nunforeseen challenges. \nThrough the strategic plan, investment in R&I is directed towards \ntackling key global \nchallenges\n such as: climate change; pollution; the loss of biodiversity; the digital transition; \nan ageing population; and building a more resilient, competitive, democratic and inclusive \nEurope.\nThe analytical foundation of the document is set out in a comprehensive \nstrategic plan \nanalysis\n1\n conducted by the Commission. This analysis covers the EU™s R&I landscape in \na global perspective, including: (i) current and future global challenges; (ii) new research \nneeds and opportunities; and (iii) how Horizon Europe could potentially address these new \nresearch needs and opportunities. The analysis also includes a large public consultation\n2\n with  \nrespondents representing a broad range of stakeholders. The analysis con˙rmed the need \nfor Horizon Europe to continue focusing on the current EU priorities in the 2025-2027 period: \nin particular: \n(i) the green transition; (ii) the digital transition; and (iii) building a more \nresilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic Europe\n.\nTo ensure a sound foundation for investment in R&I, the Commission draˆed the strategic plan \nusing a \nco-design approach\n engaging a broad number of stakeholders. These stakeholders \nworked together to set common priorities to strengthen Europe™s knowledge base through \nfrontier research, breakthrough innovation, and the development and implementation of \ninnovative solutions to achieve Europe™s priorities. To fully harness their expertise, stakeholders  \nwill also be \ninvolved in the preparation of Horizon Europe work programmes\n3\n . \nThe strategic plan is also a \ncommunication tool\n reaching beyond the research community. It \nprovides an overview of the main EU priorities for R&I, and invites a broad audience involved \nin Œ or interested in Œ the European R&I agenda to identify funding opportunities: from policy \nmakers and private investors to potential applicants and the general public. \n1.

This has also put the ambition of the EU™s green and digital transitions under \npressure. At the same time, the pace of climate change is accelerating. Europe is by now the \nfastest-warming continent of the world\n4\n , which has extensive socio-economic, environmental  \nand health consequences. In the future, the developments in digital technologies, including \nArti˙cial Intelligence (AI), will de˙ne the world we live in. For these reasons, it is becoming \neven more urgent to take transformation measures towards supporting the objectives of \nthe European Green Deal, the digital transition and boosting our \nindustrial competitiveness.\nAs laid down in the legal base\n5\n , the strategic plan is designed to \nfacilitate the implementation of the speci˙c programme of Horizon \nEurope, promoting consistency between the work programmes, \nEU priorities, and national priorities. The strategic plan acts as a \ncompass to help policymakers: (i) stay on course with the green and \ndigital transitions; and (ii) respond to new challenges. The strategic \nplan also identi˙es current gaps in R&I funding and takes into \naccount the lessons learnt from Horizon 2020 and since the launch \nof Horizon Europe.\n4.

At least 35% of Horizon Europe™s resources are committed to be spent on \nclimate action and 10% for 2025-2027 on biodiversity action. \n \nŁ\nThe digital transition\n: Research to support the digital transition is key to Europe™s \ncompetitiveness and open strategic autonomy\n6\n , and to setting human-centred standards.  \nIt is also key to achieving the green transition. In 2021-2027, it is agreed to invest at \nleast EUR 13 billion from Horizon Europe in core digital technologies.\n \nŁ\nA more resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic Europe\n: Europe™s social rights \nand democratic values and principles need a strong foundation so they can be promoted \nglobally. Horizon Europe research activities will help provide this foundation. This includes  \nresearch on civil security, on a fair and environmentally friendly economic model, on \nhealth and wellbeing and on democratic participation.\nOpen strategic autonomy\n and securing \nEurope™s leading role in developing and deploying  \ncritical technologies\n are overarching principles that apply across all three key strategic \norientations. \nHorizon Europe oˇers a wide range of instruments for research-based solutions: from \nfundamental research through to breakthrough innovation and on to the development and \nimplementation of innovative solutions. \nThe key strategic orientations are the guiding principles for all parts of \nHorizon Europe and \nwill be implemented through the work programmes 2025-2027\n. The section ‚How will the \npillars of Horizon Europe help deliver on the key strategic orientations?™ section provides more  \ndetailed information about the role of \nPillars I, II, III and the ‚Widening Participation and \nStrengthening the ERA part™\n to the key strategic orientations.\nHorizon Europe has an explicit and \nambitious commitment\n to spend at least \n35% of its \nfunding resources on climate action\n. To further step-up action for biodiversity, Horizon \nEurope also commits to increasing investment in \nbiodiversity to 10%\n of the Horizon Europe \nbudget for 2025-2027. In addition, the framework programme includes a target to spend at \nleast EUR 13 billion on \ncore digital technologies\n during 2021-2027. \nThe strategic plan aims to coordinate work in the EU and beyond in order to both increase \nthe impact of investment in R&I and boost \nEurope™s leadership in science and innovation\n. \nIn addition, \ninternational cooperation\n will remain the bedrock of the EU™s endeavours to: (i) \nlead the green and digital transitions; (ii) address global health and environmental challenges \nat the right level; (iii) make Europe more resilient and stronger in the world; and (iv) promote \nopen strategic autonomy\n.

Digital technologies have a key role to play in making our economy and \nindustry (more) resource e˛cient, less polluting, circular and climate neutral. Similarly, the \ngreen transition of energy, mobility and industry sectors can help counteract the growing \ndemand for energy and natural resources and reduce the environmental footprint of the \ndigital sector. Both the green and the digital transitions, together with the new geopolitical \nsituation and global health threats, call for a resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic \nEurope.\nTo achieve the EU™s ambitions re˚ected in the new key strategic orientations, it is also \nessential and urgent to safeguard Europe™s open strategic autonomy and to secure Europe™s \nleading role in developing and deploying critical and emerging technologies.

Contributions of pillars and clusters to each of the key strategic \norientations are described in the following chapter.\nKey strategic orientation 1: Green transition\nThe European Green Deal\n17\n outlines an ambitious plan to address climate, energy and \nenvironmental challenges while boosting Europe™s competitiveness. It aims to create a more \njust, inclusive and sustainable future by ensuring the security of food and of other critical \nresources. This includes protecting and restoring nature, reversing ecosystem degradation \nand biodiversity loss, and keeping human activities within the safe limits of planetary \nboundaries and the carrying capacity of the planet. A key goal for Europe is to become the \nworld™s ˙rst climate-neutral continent by 2050. To achieve this, the EU must shiˆ towards a \ngrowth model that bene˚ts the planet\n more than it harms it.\nHorizon Europe will deliver on the European Green Deal. Investment under Horizon Europe \nwill be aligned with strategic priorities helping to bring about the green transition, promoting \nsocietal changes, and prioritising circular and less polluting practices as well as systemic \nand behavioural changes. This will help reduce the pressure on natural resources, enabling \nsustainable development, generating sustainable quality jobs and ensuring economic \ninclusivity to leave no one behind. The green transition™s success relies on creating a strong, \ncompetitive, clean and sustainable economy based on renewable energy and circularity \nprinciples, along with a skilled workforce.\nHorizon Europe does not only sustain the EU™s leadership in climate and biodiversity diplomacy  \nand green innovation, but it also increases the \nEU™s open strategic autonomy\n in the area. \nThis path involves modernising and decarbonising Europe™s industry and society, driven by \nleadership in net zero technologies and circular economy.\nGiven the urgency of the \ntriple planetary crisis\n of climate change, biodiversity loss and \npollution as well as other environmental challenges, addressing this crisis requires an \nunprecedented mobilisation of R&I across all sectors. This encompasses collaborative \nfundamental research and innovative solutions, particularly in areas like health, urban \nplanning, construction, energy e˛ciency, mobility, agriculture and food systems. People \nshould see green transition projects in their daily lives and living spaces, for example through  \ninitiatives like the New European Bauhaus\n18\n. EU Missions are a key tool to support the green \ntransition.\n17.

In particular, it will be necessary to improve the EU™s response in two areas: (i) its \nresilience\n to climate-related extreme events like heatwaves, ˚oods, droughts and wild˙res; \nand (ii) its readiness to confront the emergence of new, climate-related, cross-border health \nand biological threats. Improvements in these two areas will also have the co-bene˙ts \nof protecting cultural heritage and landscapes from natural and human-made risks and \nbetter addressing water resilience. These improvements will also require: (i) behavioural \nand structural change at societal level; (ii) transformational decision-making; and (iii) social \nacceptance. To prepare for these changes, it will be important to conduct research in social \nsciences, humanities, law, and governance. Raising awareness to social and collective \nresponsibility and the trust in and the uptake of sustainable solutions as well as facilitating \nco-creation processes are part of this. \nKey strategic orientation 2: Digital transition\nInvestment in R&I in \nkey digital technologies\n is crucial for improving Europe™s competitiveness  \nin the digital value chain, integrating world-leading digital capabilities and technologies into \nits economy and industry, and strengthening its position in global markets of innovative \ngoods and services. Such investment is also crucial to ensure that digital technologies uphold,  \nby design, Europe™s principles and values, and peoples™ rights. \nArti˙cial intelligence is transforming our society and the way we do science. It acts as a \ncatalyst for scienti˙c breakthroughs in a variety of scienti˙c ˙elds and a key instrument in \nthe scienti˙c progress needed for tackling the green and digital transitions. Geopolitically, \nleadership in AI-powered science is essential for Europe™s competitive edge, prosperity, \nand technological sovereignty. The European AI-strategy is guided by the dual principle of \nexcellence\n in AI and \ntrustworthy\n AI, which, along with a thorough but innovation-friendly \nregulatory framework, such as the Arti˙cial Intelligence Act\n19\n, can harness AI™s vast potential \nwhile protecting the rights and private spheres of the European people. Achieving this depends  \non the collective commitment of all stakeholders in the European scienti˙c and innovation \ncommunity to develop research and innovation ecosystems that are AI-ready. Encouraging \npeople Œ especially underrepresented groups Œ to get involved is essential for advancing the \ndevelopment of trustworthy and bias-free Arti˙cial Intelligence. \nThe EU™s ability to defend and promote its economic and societal interests, as well as its \ncredibility as a strong policy actor on the global stage, will largely be a function of its cyber \nresilience and digital technologies command. Therefore, it is important to identify and \ntackle high-risk dependencies in areas like semiconductors, photonics, digital infrastructure \n(high-performance computing, cloud-edge computing, communication networks), quantum \ntechnologies, cybersecurity, arti˙cial intelligence (AI) and data, immersive technologies \nand emerging ones. The EU must be able to shape and orient the development of digital \ntechnologies over time according to its values and in line with its socio economic model \nensuring a human-centred perspective.\n19.

Therefore, a successful digital transition is also \nkey to fostering the green transition. Building on Europe™s competitiveness in digital research,  \ncross-disciplinary research\n can bring tangible bene˙ts to the natural environment. This \napplies to areas like smart agriculture, ˙sheries control, zero pollution, net-zero and climate-\nresilient industry, and circular economy.\nA comprehensive approach, ranging from collaborative fundamental research to innovative \nsolutions, is crucial for advancing emerging digital technologies, identifying and fostering \ncritical technologies and strategic sectors, assessing their impacts, and addressing \nweaknesses. Likewise, responsibly capitalising on the transformational potential of advanced  \ntechnologies such as AI in the research process, industry and society is key to sustain Europe™s  \ncompetitive edge and contribute to tackling societal challenges more eˇectively.\nUnderstanding the impacts of the digital transformation and carefully guiding related \ninvestment in R&I are key to safeguard the \nEuropean values\n, including identifying and \ncounteracting negative rebounds and misuse that can potentially undermine the European \nsocial and economic fabric. Anchored in the European social rights and values, the \ndevelopment of key digital technologies enables people and businesses to experience and \nuse the power of digital developments in a new, human-centred, secure, and inclusive way, \npromoting social justice and greater economic equality.\nKey strategic orientation 3: A more resilient, competitive, inclusive, and \ndemocratic Europe\nBuilding a more resilient, competitive, inclusive and democratic Europe is a complex task that  \ndemands a comprehensive approach, inextricably linked with the EU™s ambition for the green \nand digital transitions. R&I can help us better understand and overcome security challenges \nand external constraints when building up the future society as inclusive, democratic, and \nprotective of people™s health and well being.\nTo become more \nresilient\n, the EU will put more focus on \npreventing and responding to various threats to the EU™s civil \nsecurity.

    "page_41": "39\nSPECIFIC ISSUES\nA number of important, speci˙c cross-cutting issues should be considered when implementing  \nHorizon Europe in 2025-2027. These cross-cutting issues, which aim to create a sound \nfoundation for following the key strategic orientations described above, have been revised in \nthe light of new developments since the adoption of the ˙rst Horizon Europe strategic plan.\nBALANCE BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION\nAll key strategic orientations require R&I activities at diˇerent stages of maturity.\nProduct and process innovations contribute to economic and societal impact pathways. They \nare important for open strategic autonomy and sovereignty in industrial value chains and \ncan be described in terms of technology readiness levels (TRLs). However, some knowledge-\ngenerating activities with a societal and scienti˙c impact go beyond the technology based \nTRL logic. Nevertheless, they lay the foundation for the next generation of technologies and \nare also crucial for societal transformation processes. R&I activities for societal transitions \nrequire recognising wider groups of innovation stakeholders such as civil society, public \nservices and local administrations, and their innovation needs and opportunities.\nThe 2025-2027 Horizon Europe work programmes will be designed to provide a balanced \nsupport to activities with a range of maturity and of technology readiness levels, ranging \nfrom knowledge-generating and early-stage research to innovation, demonstration and ˙rst \ndeployment activities, such as in model regions, living labs and lighthouses. Collaborative \nresearch projects with low technology readiness levels and maturity levels are also key for \nmore impactful and innovative outcomes and will be strengthened in Pillar II. The 2025-2027  \nHorizon Europe work programmes and their support to intergovernmental actions like COST \nand EUREKA will aim to provide more opportunities for collaborative, knowledge-generating \nactivities.\nTo make the role of knowledge-generating activities more visible and provide additional \nopportunities, topics will better describe inherent societal, non-technological elements of \nexpected outcomes while refraining from describing activities or outputs of projects to be \nfunded. In this context, the Commission will work towards developing an approach as regards  \nwhen and how societal readiness should be considered and aims at testing it in selected \ntopics. This concept implies an interdisciplinary approach to projects, involving greater \nsensitivity and consideration about whether research and innovation match societal needs. \nEˇorts will also be made to include more open and less prescriptive topics as well as a range \nof expected project sizes.\n",
    "page_42": "40\nTHE INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES\nThe increasing complexity of emerging phenomena cannot be fully understood or addressed \nfrom within knowledge silos, and requires confrontation and collaboration between diverse \nmethods and approaches to the study of the same issue. Knowledge from social sciences and  \nhumanities (SSH), including arts, is particularly important to explore diˇerent meanings and \ndimensions that global challenges bring with them and to foster re˚exivity over the methods \nthrough which they are enquired. SSH is fundamental for paving the way to interdisciplinary \ncollaborations, with knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM),  \nwhile maintaining a human-centric focus. Original approaches need to be tested to support \nthe uptake of interdisciplinary skills for the future, from basic education that fosters critical \nknowledge and an open mindset to vocational training for the (re-) and (up-) skilling of the \nworkforce.\nEˇectively integrating SSH into all clusters, including all missions and partnerships, is a key \nprinciple of the programme. \nSSH are a key part of R&I, especially for the twin green and digital transitions and demographic  \nchange. This is re˚ected by ˚agging speci˙c topics and requesting an assessment of their \nsocietal impact. SSH will be integrated into such projects, from their draˆing to their selection  \nand evaluation by evaluators with demonstrable SSH expertise. \nTHE ROLE OF KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES IN SCIENCE, \nINNOVATION AND STRATEGIC VALUE CHAINS\nEurope™s industry faces multiple challenges including increasingly knowledge-intensive \nproduction, meeting the needs of the twin green and digital transitions and enabling the \nEU™s open strategic autonomy and global leadership. Key enabling technologies\n45\n (KETs) are \nkey to responding to these challenges, crucial for Europe™s strategic value chains and for \napplications in health, energy, mobility and biomanufacturing. They therefore need to be \ndeveloped across a broad range of technology readiness levels.\nDeveloping and mastering KETs can contribute towards EU industrial leadership in global \nmarkets, solving global challenges and achieving a sustainable, circular and climate-neutral \nEU economy. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) tend to use KETs less frequently \nand less eˇectively than larger companies (an issue that cannot be addressed by Horizon \nEurope actions alone) and therefore lose out on the potential they bring. Eˇorts will be made \nto allow SMEs to pro˙t from KET topics.\n45. The key enabling technologies of the future include advanced materials and nanotechnology; photonics and micro- and nano-electronics; life-\nscience technologies; advanced manufacturing and processing; AI; digital security; and connectivity.\n",

Moreover, Pillar I of Horizon \nEurope, ‚Excellent Science™ will contribute to relevant scienti˙c breakthroughs and the \nresearch infrastructures needed to develop KETs at their earlier phases, including for Arti˙cial  \nIntelligence applications in diˇerent scienti˙c ˙elds, while developing KETs in later phases \nwill be supported by pilot projects on Technology Infrastructures. Pillar III, ‚Innovative Europe™,  \nwill support breakthrough innovations based on KETs, such as quantum technologies and \nphotonics towards higher TRL and industrial deployment.\nGENDER EQUALITY AND INCLUSIVENESS, INCLUDING THE \nINTEGRATION OF GENDER CONCERNS INTO R&I\nGender equality is a cross-cutting priority in Horizon Europe and concerns all programme \nparts. Activities will aim to eliminate gender inequality and intersecting social inequalities \nŒ including those based on age, disability, ethnic or racial origin, and LGBTIQ identity Œ \nthroughout R&I systems, including by addressing unconscious biases, stereotypes, and \nsystemic structural barriers.\nIntegrating the gender dimension into R&I content will continue to be a default requirement \nacross the whole programme\n46\n unless a topic speci˙es otherwise, or applicants can duly \njustify its non-relevance.

They are also critical for delivering human-\ncentred green and digital innovations that incorporate European values. Horizon Europe \nwill continue to promote the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, to require \n46.

Processes to enable this are now well established \nand the monitoring framework for climate-related expenditure has developed signi˙cantly.\nHowever, the ability to react to shortfalls in meeting the 35% target is undermined by the \nsigni˙cant interval of time between programming work programme actions and actual \nimplementation of the projects, which leads to delays in reliable monitoring data. The latest \nestimates based on monitoring data for 2021-2022 indicate that for 2021-2022 35% of \nthe total budget is dedicated to climate objectives. For 2023-24, based on ex-ante estimates  \nand partial monitoring data, the ˙gure is likely to be slightly below 35%. This calls for: (i) \nmaintaining the steering procedures and reducing further, as part of risk management, the \nover-estimation of the climate aspects of topics; (ii) ensuring that necessary measures are \nimplemented so that the overall 35% target is reached across all 7 years of the programme; \nand (iii) that the ex-ante estimation of climate expenditures are complemented by ex-post \n˙gures for the completed years of the programme.\nRe˚ecting the importance of tackling the dramatic loss of biodiversity, Horizon Europe is \ncommitted to raising investment in \nbiodiversity\n to 10% of its total budget for 2025 to \n2027.

Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society\nThe expected impact is that people of all ages in the EU stay healthy, resilient, and independent  \neven as society changes fast. This will arise from healthier lifestyles and behaviour, healthier \ndiets, healthier environments, improved evidence-informed health policies, and more \neˇective solutions for health and well-being promotion, disease prevention and monitoring, \nand rehabilitation.\nResearch and innovation (R&I) is needed to improve the understanding of health and care \nneeds throughout the life course, including those related to health disparities (e.g. needs \nspeci˙c to age, sex, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation and vulnerable populations). \nWith this knowledge, more personalised, eˇective, accessible, and aˇordable solutions can be \ndeveloped for promoting health and well-being, pursuing health equity, preventing diseases, \nand for planning, implementing and monitoring care and (re)habilitation. This includes \naddressing the needs related to chronic health conditions, physical disabilities, mental health \nissues and disabilities, or age-related impairments. R&I can support people, communities, \nand policymakers in developing technologically and/or socially innovative services, policies, \nguidelines and digital solutions for health promotion, disease prevention and (re)habilitation \nin ways that are accessible, equitable, and eˇective. R&I can also provide new evidence, \nmethodologies and tools to increase health and digital health literacy, encourage healthy \nbehaviour, and empower individuals across all age groups to manage their own health. \nKey to delivering on this expected impact is the availability and accessibility of real-world \nhealth data, which will require appropriate use and governance of existing and emerging \ndata resources (e.g. European Health Data Space, research and data infrastructures). R&I \nactivities will contribute to the European care strategy\n70\n and the digital transformation of \nhealth and care in the EU\n71\n.\n69. \n \n\nProposal for a Regulation laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and \nestablishing rules governing the European Medicines Agency, \nCOM(2023) 193\n , 2023/0131(COD), 26.4.2023\n70.

    "page_55": "53\n2. Living and working in a health-promoting environment\nThe expected impact is that people's living and working environments are health-promoting \nand sustainable thanks to a better understanding of the environmental, occupational, social, \nsex and gender-related, and economic determinants of health.\nResearch and innovation will produce new evidence, methodologies, and technologically and/\nor socially innovative tools to understand, identify and assess the risks and bene˙ts of these \ndeterminants for human health, and to enable inclusive policy actions to promote health and \nprevent disease. Results will support the EU™s overarching policy frameworks such as the \nEuropean Health Union and its EU Global Health Strategy, the EU non-communicable diseases  \ninitiative, the EU strategic framework on health and safety at work and the European Green \nDeal and related policy initiatives, including the chemical strategy for sustainability, the zero-\npollution action plan, the 8th Environment Action Programme, the EU biodiversity strategy \nand the EU policy on climate adaptation and resilience. The outcome will also contribute \nto the development of new and improved public health actions (considering a One Health \napproach when relevant) and help foster health-promoting behaviour in living and working \nenvironments. To achieve sustainable impacts, R&I must follow a 'health in all policies' \napproach, providing evidence and stimulating its uptake into policies at EU, national, regional \nand local levels. Research and innovation should also consider today™s major environmental \nchallenges such as the triple planetary crisis concerning the intertwining of pollution, climate \nchange and biodiversity loss, as well as climate-related environmental hazards (e.g. ˚oods \nand droughts) and their impacts on health. It should also consider the bene˙ts of healthy \nenvironments for human health and well-being. Strong collaboration across sectors, including  \nwith other Horizon Europe clusters and EU Missions, will be needed to secure the best possible  \noutcomes for society. Cross-sectoral collaboration will also help empower citizens to place \nenvironmentally friendly options at the centre of their decision-making and to adopt health-\npromoting behaviour. International cooperation, for example with the European Environment \nand Health Process, and synergies between Horizon Europe projects and partnerships working  \nin similar areas, including at science-policy level, will drive forward research and innovation \nto deliver on this expected impact.\n3. Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden\nThe expected impact is that healthcare providers improve their ability to tackle and \nmanage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, \nnon-communicable and rare diseases) thereby reducing the disease burden on patients \nand enabling healthcare systems to perform more eˇectively. It can be achieved through \nbetter understanding, prevention, diagnostics, treatment, management, and cure of diseases \nand their co- and multi-morbidities, more eˇective and innovative health technologies and \nmedical countermeasures, better ability and preparedness to manage pandemic and/or \nepidemic outbreaks, and improved patient safety,\nThere is a need to continue supporting research and innovation to provide new or improved \nprevention and preparedness measures, early diagnosis and screening, public health \ninterventions, diagnostics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies (including \n",

All \nthese new approaches and measures should create tangible impacts, considering sex and/\nor gender diˇerences and health equity-related issues, patient safety, and health and digital \nliteracy (including overcoming vaccine hesitancy). International cooperation is indispensable \nto rapidly advance research and innovation by pulling together the best expertise and know-\nhow available worldwide, to access world-class resources and research infrastructures, and \nto leverage a critical scale of investment on priority needs through better alignment with \nother funders of international health R&I. The strengthening of international partnerships \nand cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to respond to major \nunmet needs for global health security and patient safety, including transborder aspects of \nemerging epidemics and pandemics and the global burden of chronic diseases. Partnering \nwith international organisations will also accelerate the understanding of brain health.\n4. Ensuring equal access to innovative, sustainable, and high-quality healthcare\nThe expected impact is that healthcare systems provide equal access to innovative, \nsustainable and high-quality healthcare thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-\neˇective and people-centred solutions. This is to be accompanied by management models \nfocusing on population health, health systems resilience, and health equity and patient \nsafety, and also improved evidence-informed health policies.\nR&I activities are needed to support the development of technologically and/or socially \ninnovative solutions for healthcare systems in all their various dimensions (e.g. reform \nand policymaking, governance and ˙nancing, resilience to and preparedness for health \nemergencies and climate change, healthcare workforce recruitment, skills, retention and \nwell-being, health service provision and sustainability, interaction with patients, and patient \nempowerment). In addition, research and innovation can provide decision-makers with new \nevidence, methods and tools to successfully implement those innovative solutions into their \nhealthcare systems, and to do so equitably and inclusively. Research and innovation can help \ndeliver solutions that are scalable and transferable between diˇerent types of healthcare \nsystems in diˇerent national, regional and local contexts. It can also provide knowledge \nthat supports the transfer of solutions between countries including on measures to address \nhealth inequalities. In turn, this will help improve the governance, resilience and integration of \nhealthcare systems, and the allocation of resources matching people™s needs and preferences  \nin a sustainable way that enables needs to be met also in the long term. Sustainability \nincludes not only social and ˙scal aspects but also environmental and climate sustainability, \nmaking sure the health sector reduces its carbon footprint and supports sustainable use of \nresources. R&I activities will contribute to among other things the European care strategy, the  \ndigital transformation of health and care in the EU, the EU digital strategy, the EU strategy \non adaptation to climate change and the European Green Deal.\n",
    "page_57": "55\n5. \n \n\nDeveloping and using new tools, technologies, and digital solutions for a \n \nhealthy society\nThe expected impact is that health technologies, data, new tools, and digital solutions are \napplied eˇectively thanks to their inclusive, ethically sound, secure and sustainable delivery, \nintegration and deployment in health policies and in health and care systems. \nSupport for R &I is needed on the large spectrum of tools and technologies for biomedical \nresearch, prevention, diagnosis, therapy and health monitoring. This includes enabling \ntechnologies not least innovative biotechnological approaches. The emergence of the \nEuropean Health Data Space will create an additional boost to cross-border, data-driven \napproaches and innovation, e.g. for personalised medicine or patient safety. High-quality \nhealth data (incl. real world data) combined with digital technologies, modelling, and AI \ntools, such as advanced human digital twin solutions, have a high potential for advancing \nR&I that supports healthcare systems and pandemic preparedness and response. It is \nparamount that these data driven approaches and technologies are inclusive and consider \ngender diˇerences as well as various user needs. To boost the development and acceptance \nof new technologies and implement them successfully and responsibly into health policies \nand health and care systems, it will be essential to anticipate the regulatory and market \naccess challenges that they may face and manage their bene˙ts and risks. This involves \ncareful consideration of safety, eˇectiveness, interoperability, appropriateness, accessibility, \ncomparative value added, and sustainability (environmental, ˙scal, and socio-economic) as \nwell as ethical, societal, regulatory, and legal issues. The development and uptake of new \ntechnologies for high-quality healthcare, increasingly based on personalised approaches, will \nneed to draw on multiple disciplines and require cross-sectoral cooperation among all those \nconcerned, including end-users (patients, healthcare providers and workforce, researchers, \nregulatory bodies, policymakers, and funders). These interactions will help address unmet \nneeds via integrated tools, hybrid health technologies and digital solutions (including those \nwith limited commercial interest). It will also support the design and development of health \nproducts and services tailored to the needs of speci˙c population groups, thereby improving \npatient outcomes and reducing health inequalities.\n6. Maintaining an innovative, sustainable, and competitive EU health industry\nThe expected impact is that the EU health industry is innovative, sustainable, and globally \ncompetitive thanks to improved uptake of breakthrough technologies and innovations \n(including social innovations) that make the EU with its Member States and Associated \nCountries more resilient and less reliant on imports of critical health technologies.\nThere is a need to further support cross-sectoral R&I and the convergence of health \ntechnologies (integrating medical technologies, pharmaceuticals, biotechnologies, digital \nhealth, and e-health technologies) to strengthen the single market. R&I is needed to help \nimplement the digital single market strategy and the pharmaceutical strategy for Europe, \nand to support standardisation and demand-driven innovation. Providing evidence and \nguidelines for stakeholders, policymakers and regulators will also help stimulate the take-up \nof innovations that contribute to sustainability (environmental, ˙scal and socio-economic) \n",

This means additional development steps, uncertainties, and a \nlonger time to market. Therefore, it remains important to ensure continued support to studies  \nfor health assessment procedures, clinical performance demonstration, quality assurance \nschemes and standardisation. Research and innovation are also still needed to develop \nnew cross-sectoral business models that enable health-related industries to cooperate \nearly with healthcare systems in the development of value-added products and services for \neˇective uptake and deployment of innovative solutions. Such solutions should deliver on \nthe triple aim of improving the patient experience of care (including safety, quality, equity \nand satisfaction), improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita cost of \nhealthcare. Furthermore, when there is an unmet need and a market failure, incentives and \nsupport will be considered to promote the demand of innovative goods and services and to \nfoster the uptake of innovation in health systems. \nTable 1\n \n.

This continuity ensures a stable and predictable funding \nenvironment for policy-oriented, interdisciplinary, European collaborative research involving \nsocial sciences and humanities, including the arts. However, this strategic plan needs to \nconsider the challenges that have put the resilience of European societies and the world \nunder pressure.\nAs such, activities in Cluster 2 will continue to focus on challenges pertaining to democratic \ngovernance, inclusiveness, cultural heritage and the creative economy, and on ensuring just \nand fair green and digital transitions. Russia™s war of aggression against Ukraine, a European \nneighbourhood and EU candidate country, is already having profound and long-term impacts.  \nThe exacerbated con˚ict in the Middle East has led to polarisation in European society, \nincluding an ominous resurgence of antisemitism and other forms of hatred. The impacts of \nsuch challenges can be felt not only on societies, economies, geopolitics and international \nrelations, but also on identities, interpretations of history and culture, science policy decisions,  \nand important new research avenues to explore. The current context of complex, mutually \nreinforcing crises cannot be properly understood without the help of interdisciplinary expertise  \nmobilising social sciences and humanities. Similarly, social acceptance of policy solutions and  \ntrust in democratic decision-making cannot be achieved without citizen engagement and \ninclusive education, training and cultural participation.\nAll these global challenges are interconnected, whether they are geopolitical, or relate to the \npublic health, energy, climate or digital transformations, changes in the nature of democratic \nsystems and political landscapes, migration, or the profound recon˙gurations of global \nmarkets, value chains and the realms of work and productivity. Addressing the concerns and \nexpectations of the European public in that respect goes far beyond technological innovation \nand technocratic solutions: it is a major issue of political participation, social justice, economic \nfairness and of environmental and cultural sustainability.\nThis is why the extensive mobilisation of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary research involving \nsocial sciences and humanities, including the arts, is at the core of the 2025-2027 strategic \nplan. International comparison and cooperation will gain further attention in the cluster work \nprogrammes for the period 2025-2027. The regional and local dimension of policies in the \n˙eld of governance, cultural heritage and inclusiveness may be further explored.\nFirst, research and innovation actions in the cluster will address knowledge gaps and policy  \nneeds concerning the impact of the armed con˚icts, resource scarcity, technological change, and  \ngeopolitical tensions on the health of European democracies. Investments will help foster more  \nresilient European democracies better prepared to withstand threats, both external and internal.  \nThey will also contribute to designing innovative ways to update Europe™s democratic systems to  \nmake them more inclusive, transparent, accountable and representative of the people.\n",
    "page_66": "64\nSecond, research and innovation at the intersection between technology, the arts, and access \nto culture will explore the means to boost the societal value of tangible and intangible \ncultural heritage. The innovation potential of the cultural and creative sectors and industries \nwill be supported by, for instance, sectoral analysis and ecosystem approaches, practice-, \narts-, and performance-based research. The multidimensional nature of cultural heritage will  \nbe explored and developed in the context of the green and digital transitions. \nThird, research will help to understand and thus resolve forms of inequalities in addition \nto income inequality or gender inequality, such as territorial (rural-urban divide) and \nenvironmental inequality, and well-being and health inequality (including mental health). \nFurthermore, research under this cluster will investigate the contribution of both European \nand national cohesion, regional, urban and rural development policies to sustainable fair, \ngreen and digital transitions. It will also consider the impacts of demographic changes, \nmigration, ageing, and diversity. \nIn addition, an important strategic innovation is the establishment of two new European \nPartnerships co-funded with national authorities: ‚Social Transformations and Resilience™ and  \n‚Resilient Cultural Heritage™. They will strengthen the alignment of national and European \nresearch and innovation policies and funding.\nHOW WILL CLUSTER2 MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\nCluster 2 will programme investment to achieve the following four expected impacts.\nExpected Impacts\n7. Reinvigorating democratic governance\nThe impact means that democratic governance is reinvigorated by improving the accountability,  \ntransparency, eˇectiveness and trustworthiness of institutions and policies based on rule \nof law, and through the expansion of active and inclusive citizenship empowered by the \nsafeguarding of fundamental rights.\nThe aim of the research investment supporting this impact is to develop a robust evidence \nbase on which to form eˇective, relevant and sensitive policies that bolster the resilience \nof democratic systems and protect them from threats. R&I actions will aim to increase the \ncapacity of researchers and policy makers to better understand geopolitical shiˆs and shape \nthe EU™s role in the world. Part of this eˇort will include promoting human rights globally and \nensuring peace in Europe, contributing thus to internal and external EU policies that allow/\nensure respect for citizens™ fundamental freedoms (with particular attention to neighbourhood  \ncountries). In this context, and in light of the con˚icts in Ukraine and the Middle East, activities \nwill measure and evaluate the impact of wars and post-con˚ict reconstruction on governance  \n",

In addition, the research will encompass the protection of democracy \nfrom external and internal threats, including foreign interference and manipulation of \ninformation, disinformation and other forms of hybrid threats, together with an analysis \nof the eˇectiveness of science diplomacy as a way to strengthen multilateral cooperation.\nThe expected impact of the funded projects also includes reaching a deeper understanding \nof radicalisation processes and the risk of violent extremism, especially if conveyed by \npolitical motivation and populist movements, to eˇectively limit its most extreme and \nviolent expressions through participation and inclusion. Part of the research will encompass \nunderstanding the transformation of politics and the evolving landscape of representative \ndemocracy, including the role played by national elites, polarisation and socio-cultural tensions  \nbetween majority and minority populations. Funded actions will aim to support the creation \nof a European research hub on contemporary antisemitism and Jewish life and culture\n73\n, \nand will also seek to deepen understanding of hatred, identifying its drivers and ways to \naddress it. The projects will also aim to improve education for democratic citizenship, focusing \nespecially on educating young people to participate in democratic governance, and involving \nthem in decision-making processes. The challenges to democracy that will be investigated \nare also those posed by digital transformation: the impact is to improve the understanding \nof emerging technologies (such as arti˙cial intelligence, big data, and the metaverse) and \ntheir impact on policymaking, public service delivery and governance. Activities can thus \ncontribute to the eˇectiveness of public administrations and services. Those will include the \njudicial system whose e˛ciency and independence could be assessed and enhanced through \nthe funded R&I actions.\nAs in the rest of Horizon Europe, the gender dimension of these issues will have to be \nconsidered, and intersectional approaches will be encouraged. Cultural, philosophical and \nhistorical perspectives, in combination with theoretical rigour, experimentation and normative \nre˚ection, will set the framework for soundly understanding present developments and help \nto map future pathways. In the medium to long term, the knowledge, data, and scienti˙cally \nrobust recommendations and innovations generated will enhance decision-making on all \naspects relevant to democratic governance.\n8. Realising the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors\nThe expected impact implies that the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and \ncreative industries and sectors as drivers of both sustainable innovation and a European \nsense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, the general \npublic, and economic sectors. \nThe research and innovation actions contributing to this expected impact will pursue three \n73.

Investments will aim to widen the understanding of \nand engagement with cultural heritage. An important objective will be to strengthen the role \nof cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries and sectors in supporting prosperous \nand environmentally, socially and culturally sustainable and resilient societies. \nTherefore, R&I actions will aim to reinforce the innovation potential of cultural heritage and \ncultural and creative industries and sectors, as well as their contributions to the economy \nand competitiveness. A special focus will be put on fostering a culture- and creativity-driven \nEuropean innovation ecosystem, with cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries \nand sectors at its heart. Research and innovation actions will be developed both holistically \nand on speci˙c sectors or issues.\nResearch and innovation results are also expected to contribute to European integration, \nsocial inclusion and to societal and territorial cohesion by focusing on better, wider and more \nequal access to tangible and intangible cultural heritage, and their connections to natural \nheritage. Research and innovation activities will focus on analysing the impact of climate \nchange on cultural heritage and exploring the contribution of cultural heritage and related \nactivities to green and sustainable development and its social acceptance. \nFuture deployment of technological advances in ˙elds such as arti˙cial intelligence and other  \ntechnologies will have far-reaching impacts on culture, well-being and living heritage, such \nas skills, values and beliefs. Research and innovation investment will help build the capacity \nto steer the development and anticipate the consequences of such technological advances. \nResearch and innovation actions will continue supporting the implementation of the European  \nCollaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage. This is expected to help improve collaboration \nbetween European cultural heritage institutions and networks and support high-quality \nacquisition, management and curation of digitised and born digital heritage assets.\nIn addition, research may further explore sustainable and inclusive cultural tourism in the EU,  \nsuch as for instance tourism for people with disabilities, youth, silver age tourism, or tourism \nrelated to dissonant heritage. Research might also address the management of heritage sites  \nand collections, assets™ provenance, and restitution issues.

Strengthening social and economic resilience and sustainability\nThis expected impact focuses on enhancing social and economic resilience and sustainability.  \nThis involves gaining a deeper understanding of the multifaceted impacts of various drivers of  \nchange, such as technological advancements, global trade patterns, climate change, shiˆing \ndemographics, and mobility and migration trends. It also emphasizes the interconnectedness  \nof these drivers. \nDemographic shiˆs, rapid technological advancements, alterations in global trade dynamics, \nthe eˇects of climate change, environmental pollution, geopolitical tensions, and migration \npressures are all ushering in profound transformations in European societies and economies. \nDespite challenges posed by various socio-political factors, it is imperative that we strengthen  \nresilience and sustainability within the EU. These transformations, although accompanied by \nuncertainties and disruptions, also present opportunities for a new direction in growth and \ninnovation. They underscore the urgent need for forward-thinking policies that foster social \ncohesion and sustainable economic development.\nThese changes ripple across society and the economy, impacting the future of work, \nproductivity, demography, migration, asylum, and mobility governance. Understanding the \nimportance of existing and emerging inequalities is critical to strengthen social justice and \nresilience in European societies. This also requires the eˇective integration of refugees, \nmigrants and people with migration background into European labour markets and societies. \nThe research and innovation investment under this expected impact will: (i) improve the \nunderstanding of how the ongoing changes impact society; and (ii) inform policy makers \non how to mitigate negative externalities and harness newly created opportunities. It will \nimprove the understanding of the interplay between diˇerent drivers of change and their \nsocial, ethical, political, and economic implications. The improved understanding of the \ncurrent challenges and their economic, social, and distributional impacts not only will ˙ll \nin the research gaps but will also inform the design and assessment of policies addressing \nexisting and emerging challenges, including in the area of well-being and particularly in \nmental health. Overall, the Cluster™s activities will help promote the EU™s inclusive growth, \nresilience, and fair transition towards climate neutrality, in line with the European Pillar of \nSocial Rights and its Action Plan, the European Education Area, the EU™s policies on jobs and \ndevelopment, and the Just Transition Mechanism. \n10. Boosting inclusive growth and reducing vulnerabilities e˜ectively\nThis expected impact revolves around fostering inclusive growth and eˇectively reducing \nvulnerabilities through evidence-based policymaking. These policies are designed to \nsafeguard and enhance employment, skills, education, well-being, social equity, and address \nvarious forms of inequality. \n",

Unlike defence research, civil security research \naims to strengthen the ability of EU™s population and of EU society to prevent, prepare for, \nand be resilient to a wide range of security threats. The EU needs to improve \nits population™s  \nprotection and resilience, and better equip its critical entities or organisations and \ninfrastructure\n against increasingly complex security threats that can exploit the increased \ninterconnectedness of the cyber and physical aspects of life, that can be hybrid, and that can \nbe land threats and/or maritime threats (including underwater and oˇshore).\nTimes of crisis are a breeding ground for the emergence of crime. The EU needs to be \nprepared to face the increasing threat from terrorism and \norganised crime\n, such as ˙rearms \ntra˛cking in the EU due to the armed con˚icts in its neighbourhood, and to be able to deal \nwith an increase in drug tra˛cking and cybercrime, as evidenced aˆer the COVID-19 crisis. \nThe potential for large-scale \nmovements of people\n, whether as a result of war, or of social/\neconomic/environmental stress, or the instrumentalisation of migration, increasingly requires  \nmulti-level situational awareness and border management capabilities. These capabilities \nneed to be eˇective, but also as little intrusive as possible, and mindful of fundamental \nrights.\nAs well as being prepared to face individual threats, the EU needs to be prepared for their \nincreased tendency to arise at the same time (compound events) and/or to trigger a chain \nof negative eˇects (cascading events), and to require the coordinated action of a number of \nsecurity practitioners to deal with them (thereby increasing complexity).

Particular attention will be paid  \nto ˚oods and wild˙res, as well as to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive \n(CBRN-E) threats.\nThe general public, local communities and voluntary organisations need to be included as \nactive partners in research, the results of which in turn need to empower citizens to act. \nResearch should help citizens to improve their own resilience to crises. Another matter that \nneeds to be addressed is the public™s perception of, and involvement in, civil defence in the \nevent of very large-scale disasters including armed con˚ict.\nResearch needs to involve local decision-makers and operational responders, i.e. ˙rst and \nsecond responders, those ˙rst in line when a security incident occurs within their premises \nsuch as infrastructure operators, local authorities and cities (public services, transport and \nutilities) as well as the competent authorities responsible for dealing with secondary impacts \n(environmental, health), and bearing in mind the socio-economic and cultural context. \nThere is a need for greater risk awareness/ preparedness, stronger governance and timely \ncommunication of the foreseeable impacts of disasters. Better capabilities could include \nstandardisation inputs, such as standard operating procedures for foresight, risk analysis \nor guidance on investing/economics in disaster risk management; trusted communication \nchannels; and other technologies resulting from research and innovation initiatives.\nCluster 3 will support the implementation of the EU Disaster Resilience Goals and UN \nDisaster Risk Reduction policies, involving closer coordination with the Union Civil Protection \nKnowledge Network, the rescEU civil protection mechanism and Member States™ civil \nprotection authorities, as well as an enhanced dialogue at international level with the United \nNations O˛ce for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) on recommendations for the Sendai \nFramework. Such closer coordination with other programmes will make it possible to further \nstreamline Cluster 3 research programming. For example, Cluster 3 should focus on its \ncore added value, which is a strong operational character for preparedness, response and \nlearning, while maintaining synergies with broader prevention issues such as climate-related \nrisks, covered by Cluster 5, and the Mission on Climate Change Adaptation. There are similar \nexamples of closer coordination with Cluster 6 and the One Health approach, regarding, \nfor instance, threats to water and food security (as a result of intentional degradation or \nterrorist acts), and impacts on air quality (as a result of wild˙res). The annual Knowledge for \nAction in Prevention and Preparedness (KAPP) calls for proposals, as well as scenario-building  \ninitiatives, represent the disaster risk management and civil protection community™s latest \nprioritisation of research needs for the policies outlined above.\n",

This sector is also one of the main causes \nof air pollution and noise and is a major source of water pollution. Greater R&I activities \nare needed, across all transport modes and in line with societal needs and preferences, for \nthe EU to reach its policy goals towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, to signi˙cantly \nreduce air pollutants and noise towards the zero-pollution ambition, and to support and \naccelerate positive developments. Electri˙cation of all modes of transport plays a key role in \nthis process, and a rapid deployment of the European battery value chain is a major priority \nto achieve this aim.\nAs regards road transport, R&I actions, in particular from the related Cluster 5 partnerships, \nwill contribute to the shiˆ to zero-emission mobility (greenhouse gases, noise and air \npollutants), ensuring that the EU remains the world leader in innovation, manufacturing \nand services in relation to road transport. R&I will target cost- and energy-e˛cient zero \ntailpipe emission vehicles (from two-wheeler to heavy-duty), smart, user-centric and cost-\neˇective static and dynamic charging infrastructure, and the integration of these vehicles \ninto a resilient mobility system and in the renewable, smart energy grid.\nAviation is a strategic sector for the EU and aims at climate neutrality by 2050 with very \nambitious technology bricks, which include hybridisation, energy e˛ciency improvements, and  \n100% use of sustainable aviation fuels and (partially) electri˙ed or hydrogen-powered, zero-\nemission commercial aircraˆ and infrastructure by 2035.

Cluster 6 supports the ambition of Europe to become the \n˙rst climate-neutral and climate-resilient continent by 2050, taking into account the current \npolitical, legal and economic context, with a long-term vision for a greener, fairer, more \nresilient society ensuring that no person or place is leˆ behind.\nCluster 6 contributes to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and \nof the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Cluster 6 is crucial for achieving the  \nambitions of the European Green Deal, contributing to the dimensions outlined below and their \nrelated policies. The implementation of unifying approaches through R&I, including the One \nHealth approach, is fundamental for Cluster 6 to deliver impactful results. The development \nof sustainable agriculture and food systems is one of the key priority areas of action for \nthe EU. Cluster 6 will support R&I needs related to the Farm to Fork Strategy (including \nrelated initiatives), the common agricultural policy, the common ˙sheries policy, and the \nEU action plan on the development of organic production. Addressing R&I gaps will further \ncontribute to laying the groundwork for systemic changes towards sustainable agricultural \nvalue chains that over time will deliver greater environmental, social and economic bene˙ts \nto and from agriculture, forestry and rural areas, the ˙sheries and aquaculture sectors, and \ncoastal areas as well as to food systems, both in the EU and globally. Moreover, the surge in \nglobal commodity and input prices, further accelerated by Russia™s war of aggression against  \nUkraine, highlighted that food and nutrition security in the EU cannot be taken for granted. \nAgriculture, ˙sheries and aquaculture, food and feed systems and related industries need \nto become more resilient, circular and resource e˛cient. Therefore, fostering sustainable \nfarming approaches, including organic farming and agroecology, sustainable aquaculture \nand sustainable food and feed systems becomes more relevant than ever to ensure food \nand nutrition security also in the long term. R&I will contribute to ensuring that food systems \nare healthy and safe for all. Fostering a dietary shiˆ ensuring sustainable food consumption \nand reducing food loss and waste will also be key. A balanced, sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment of rural and coastal areas will be essential to ensure food and nutrition security  \nand the livelihoods of the rural population, in support of the long-term vision for the EU™s \nrural areas. \nWith its strong focus on \nbiodiversity and ecosystems\n, Cluster 6 will address the loss of \nbiodiversity by supporting the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, notably the proposal for \na nature restoration law, the EU soil strategy for 2030, the proposal for a directive on \nsoil monitoring and resilience, the EU forest strategy for 2030, and the EU action plan on \nprotecting and restoring marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient ˙sheries.

This will be critical to tackle \nthe combined eˇects from multiple hazardous substances in line with the EU zero-pollution \naction plan. \nOn soil, research will develop further decontamination techniques in complementarity with \nthe Mission Soil. R&I is also needed to help address the objectives in terms of air and water \npollution from agriculture and other relevant sectors, including the land-sea interaction, \nnotably following the revision of the Industrial Emissions Directive, the Ambient Air Quality \nDirectives and EU water legislation. Environmental observation needs to be further developed  \nto ˙ll knowledge gaps related to zero pollution, and monitoring, reporting and veri˙cation data  \ngaps. In this sense, R&I activities will need to be continued to develop/optimise appropriate \nanalytical methodologies to detect and monitor emerging pollutants and pollutants of great \nconcern, including directly at their sources, for both food and feed safety and environmental \nprotection. In the context of new EU air quality acquis, air quality monitoring and modelling \nwill need improved sensitivity and accuracy. The proposed partnership on Forests and Forestry  \nfor a Sustainable Future will also play an important role in achieving this expected impact.\n30. Ensuring healthy food and nutrition security by making agriculture, ˚sheries, \naquaculture and food systems sustainable, resilient, inclusive and within planetary \nboundaries \nR&I will be a key driver in accelerating the transition to sustainable, low-ecological-footprint, \nhealthy, safe, inclusive and resilient food systems ensuring food and nutrition security from \nprimary production to consumption while improving the livelihoods of farmers, aquaculture \nproducers, ˙shers and rural communities. Farmers will continue to be empowered with \nknowledge and tools through strengthened cooperation and integration of science and \ntraditional practices to: manage land, livestock, soil, water, crops and nutrients in e˛cient, \ncircular and sustainable ways minimising and removing pollution; mitigate and adapt to \nclimate change and its impacts; and foster resilience and sustainability of crops and livestock  \nproduction while making farming a professionally attractive and remunerative life choice that  \nensures good living conditions by combining technological and social innovation solutions. A \nmore e˛cient and sustainable use of fertilisers, pesticides and antimicrobials will be fostered, \nleading to reducing and/or phasing out reliance on harmful products through the development  \nof viable alternatives, including through farming practices and crop improvement and \nadaptation. Knowledge and tools will be further developed in co-creative processes to foster \nand upscale sustainable farming approaches that are regenerative with a speci˙c focus on \nagroecology (including agroforestry and organic farming). This will unlock the potential to \nachieve the objectives set for the agricultural sector under this expected impact, including \ncontribution to food and nutrition security while preserving and strengthening biodiversity, \nplant, animal and soil health, and their related ecosystem services.\nKey research areas for agriculture will include mitigation of and adaptation to climate \n",

Cluster 6 will also address \ncrop diversi˙cation, improvement and adaptation, address pollution challenges for soil in \ncomplementarity with the Mission Soil, water and air, address nutrient losses, and improve \nbiodiversity and the provision of ecosystems services. Tools and methods will be developed \nfor the monitoring of impacts of new technologies on sustainability and resilience of the agri-\nfood system Research activities will also aim to bolster plant health, protect animal health \nand welfare, foster sustainable livestock systems, and leverage the potential of protein \nand underutilised crops. Fish and seafood production will rely on low-impact ˙shing and \naquatic ecosystems and resources, while monitoring tools will be essential to ensure their \nsustainability. Solutions will continue to be sought to reduce environmental impacts of ˙shing  \npractices. Gathering knowledge and adapting ˙sheries and aquaculture to a changing climate  \nand environment will be key to helping the sectors become more resilient.\nR&I will further help transform food systems by making them more innovative, inclusive, \ndigitally driven when relevant, and capable of ensuring access to a su˛cient supply of \naˇordable nutritious food and feed, including when facing crisis situations and socio-\neconomic transitions. Further tools to decrease the environmental footprint of food systems, \naddressing biodiversity and pollution will be developed. In line with the Farm to Fork Strategy \nand Food 2030 pathways, critical leverage points for the transition towards sustainable, \nhealthy and inclusive food systems will be tackled through R&I to foster the implementation \nof sustainable healthy diets, alternative protein foods, food waste reduction and valorisation,  \nimproved resource e˛ciency, microbiome solutions, nutrition for healthy lives, food safety \nand food fraud prevention, food systems in Africa, the digital transition, and zero-pollution \nfood systems. Environmental sustainability and circularity of food systems will be addressed,  \ntaking into account interdependencies at EU and global level. Knowledge and tools will be \nmade available to all food system stakeholders, such as farmers, aquaculture producers, \nprocessors, food service providers, and retailers, to foster their sustainability performance \nand contribute to biodiversity protection. Pollution and other relevant environmental health \nimpacts from food and beverage processing industries and downstream stakeholders will be \ninvestigated. The opportunities that environmental observations and use of data might oˇer \nto enable sustainable, resilient, eˇective and e˛cient food systems could be further explored.\n31. Sustainably developing rural, urban and coastal areas \nSustainable, balanced and inclusive development remains a challenge for many rural, coastal  \nand urban areas in Europe and globally.\nThe ageing of the population, depopulation, gender inequalities, and the lack of services and \nappropriate infrastructure hinder the scaling-up of economic opportunities beyond agriculture  \nand traditional livelihoods. R&I is needed to advance sustainable development, improve \ninclusive community services (e.g. health coverage compared to urban areas, educational and  \ncultural opportunities for children and young people, lifelong learning opportunities for adults,  \n",
    "page_131": "129\nin particular women and people in vulnerable situations) and enable rural communities to \nbene˙t from and be an active part of the digital and green transitions. Further research \nwill explore dynamics between locals and newcomers in rural areas and links to the urban \nand suburban areas. R&I will further focus on how to upscale rural-urban synergies while \nimproving territorial governance and strengthening rural innovation ecosystems. The options \nof sustainable farming approaches, including organic farming and aquaculture as well as \nagroecology, in providing economic opportunities in rural areas, preventing rural depopulation \nand attracting people back to rural areas will be explored. The cluster will also keep on \nsupporting the long-term vision for the EU™s rural areas, by contributing to developing stronger,  \nresilient, prosperous and connected rural areas and communities.\nR&I will further underpin the development of resilient, inclusive, healthy and green coastal \ncommunities. In particular, this will be done by fostering the human-nature interface with \nregard to aquatic environments, for instance by encouraging marine citizenship and ocean \nconnectedness, and by promoting nature-based solutions and blue-green infrastructure. \nInitiatives will be rolled out to support citizen science, literacy, and observation and \nstewardship of rivers, freshwater, and coastal and sea areas, in terms of knowledge, social \nprocesses and social innovation.\nUrban and peri-urban aspects related to the speci˙c areas of intervention of this cluster, such  \nas the restoration of urban ecosystems, urban agriculture and food systems, will continue \nto be studied and developed as appropriate and in complementarity with relevant missions \nand partnerships.\n32. Developing innovative governance models and tools enabling sustainability and \nresilience\nR&I will provide strong evidence-informed knowledge and tools to support policy design (for \npublic authorities, businesses and individuals) and decision-making processes (implementation, \nmonitoring, reporting and veri˙cation for achieving the necessary transformative changes).\nEnvironmental observations will be made more accessible and interoperable, building user-\ntailored, integrated products and metrics using advanced digital methodologies including AI. \nR&I and coordination activities for environmental observations, modelling and forecasting will  \nsupport building targeted and actionable environmental knowledge and insights for policy \ndesign and evaluation, as well as a more sustainable and resilient society and economy.\nR&I supporting the digital transformation of food systems and agriculture, forestry, ˙sheries \nand aquaculture sectors will increase their sustainability without harming biodiversity and the  \nenvironment. Emphasis will be placed on the use of data in agriculture to drive eˇectiveness, \ne˛ciency and sustainability considering private and public interests. This includes fostering \nthe sustainability performance of applied digital and data technologies. The data governance  \nincluding the sharing of data will be taken into account.\n",

The EU and its \nMember States played a leading role in achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity \nFramework at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP-15) (Montreal, December 2022). R&I \nactivities in Cluster 6 will be designed around the 4 goals and 23 targets for 2030 set \nout in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and will include support to the \nIntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). \nThe cluster will also support the International Resource Panel as well as the objectives of the \nGlobal Soil Partnership and the European Soil Partnership in complementarity with the EU \nMission ‚A Soil Deal for Europe™.\nThe High Seas Treaty adopted by the UN Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond \nNational Jurisdiction (New York, March 2023) represents another landmark achievement for \nensuring the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in the high seas,  \nalso thanks to provisions on knowledge on deep-sea ecosystems and impacts from human \nactivities. R&I activities will be developed to deliver on this Treaty by protecting the ocean, \ntackling environmental degradation, ˙ghting climate change, and preventing biodiversity \nloss. At the same time the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and \nthe UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration will be supported. Building on the UN Ocean \nConference (Lisbon, June 2022) and the UN Water Conference (New York, March 2023), \nwhere the importance of R&I was highlighted within the EU™s commitments, cooperation \nwith international partners will be strengthened especially through the European Partnership \nWater4All and the EU Missions ‚Restore our Ocean and Waters™ and ‚A Soil Deal for Europe™.\nCluster 6 will also support international action to stop and remove pollution. Notably, R&I will \nsupport multilateral action to end global plastic pollution, based on the resolution backed by \nthe UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) in 2022 that set up an intergovernmental negotiating \ncommittee entrusted with the task to propose a draˆ legally binding agreement by the end of  \n2024. It will also support the future Science Policy Panel on chemicals, waste and pollution, \nwhich was also agreed to be set up at the UNEA in March 2022. Moreover, R&I activities will \nfurther support the achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, ensure food and nutrition security, and address transboundary impacts, \nincluding by seeking participation of low and middle-income countries. Towards these ends, \nthe sharing of data and knowledge as well as development standards and good practice \nwill be fostered within the Group on Earth Observations. International cooperation and \ngovernance on environmental observations will be supported including by providing tools to \noptimise observing systems more objectively.\nInternational cooperation will remain of critical importance for the agricultural, marine and \nforestry sectors, rural areas and food systems (notably in the aˆermath of the UN Food \nSystems Summit of 2021), taking into account the current geopolitical developments.

Knowledge and \ninnovation arising from Horizon Europe activities are made available to farmers, foresters, \nrural communities and other stakeholders through, for example, thematic and advisory \nnetworks funded by Horizon Europe. These activities along with other multi-actor projects \nare encouraged to connect with operational groups funded under the CAP through the CAP \nstrategic plans and the European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and \nSustainability (EIP-AGRI). The EU CAP Network supports networking by bringing together \nstakeholders from the European Network for Rural Development and the EIP-AGRI. In the EU \nCAP Network, the EIP-AGRI aims to promote networking to close the gap between research and  \npractice. Existing synergies between Horizon Europe and the CAP will be further strengthened  \nfor R&I activities in agriculture, forestry and rural development including through the \nimplementation of the ‚multi-actor approach™, place-based innovation (e.g. living labs, light \nhouses and demo farms) and strengthened agricultural knowledge and innovation systems. \nKnowledge and innovation arising from Cluster 6 will continue to inform CAP developments. \nThe LIFE programme fully contributes to the European Green Deal with a high leverage \npotential of Cluster 6 R&I results. LIFE™s subprogrammes target the protection of nature \nand biodiversity; the transition towards a circular, energy-e˛cient, renewable energy-based, \nclimate-neutral and resilient economy; improvements in air quality and in the ecological \nstatus of European waters; the restoration of soils; and the reduction of hazardous chemicals.  \nLIFE facilitates sequential downstream funding of innovations by granting bonus points in \nthe evaluation when proposals build on or upscale the results of projects funded by other \nprogrammes, including Horizon Europe. It therefore acts as a catalyst for taking up and \nimplementing R&I results developed in Cluster 6.\nClose collaboration will be further developed with the EU Space Programme and the Digital \nEurope Programme in the areas of Earth observations, Earth system science, digital twins, \ndata technologies and AI, and related service developments, including the Copernicus \nservices. Furthermore, through the joint Earth System Science Initiative of the European \nCommission and the European Space Agency (ESA), R&I activities in Cluster 6 will maximise \ncomplementary roles with the ESA Future Earth Observation programme for the bene˙t of \nthe scienti˙c community and the general public, unlock the full potential of the synergistic \nopportunities between space- and ground-based observations, and develop models to \nexpand the fundamental understanding of the planet, its processes and interactions with \nhuman activities.
